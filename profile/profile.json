  "summary": "I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. During my four years of University, I have developed critical thinking and problem solving skills and have taken algorithm and design courses as well as courses that improved my Python, Java, and C programming proficiency. My software engineering course gave me experience on MERN stack development while also experiencing Agile methodologies with team members. I am currently working at Jarvis as a software developer where I have created projects using Java, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Linux/Bash Scripting. My goal is to grow and develop new skills to be the best version of myself. Also, I want to apply my knowledge to make the work environment a better place for team members, leaders, and clients."
