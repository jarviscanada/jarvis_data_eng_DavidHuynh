# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I have been working as a software developer at Teranet for approximately two years. At Teranet, I have used my problem-solving skills while resolving over 40 critical defects and performance issues with Java and XML configuration. My job has given me experience with Agile methodologies as I am working with multiple team members within different teams. Furthermore, I improved the ElasticSearch Document Content usage for more impactful search filters. At Jarvis, I have created projects using Java, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Linux/Bash Scripting. My goal is to grow and develop new skills to be the best version of myself. Also, I want to apply my knowledge to create a better work environment for team members, leaders, and clients.
