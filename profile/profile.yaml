# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: My goal is to grow and develop new skills to be the best version of myself. My favourite thing to do is to learn new programming languages as well as solve coding problems where I can put my algorithm skills to the test. Within the software industry, I hope to provide all the support and knowledge that I have gained to create a better work environment for my team members and leaders. I also wish to meet new people and be able to make the workplace a place of leisure and enjoyment as well.
