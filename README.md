# David Huynh . Jarvis Consulting

I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. During my four years of University, I have developed critical thinking and problem solving skills. I have taken algorithm and design courses as well as courses that improved my Python, Java, and C programming skills. My software engineering course gave me experience on MERN stack development while also experiencing Agile methodologies with team members. I am currently working at Jarvis as a software developer. At Jarvis, I have created projects using Java, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Linux/Bash Scripting. My goal is to grow and develop new skills to be the best version of myself. Also, I want to apply my knowledge to make the work environment a better place for team members, leaders, and clients.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented Bash scripts that allows the collection of hosts' hardware information and usage from nodes of a cluster. This data is stored in a PostgresSQL database hosted by Docker. The scripts are continuously scheduled to run using Crontab jobs.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Not Started
  - JDBC App: Created an app that allows one to manipulate customer data from a PostgreSQL database using a Data Access Object within Java. This allows a user to manipulate a database with transactions without calling multiple queries.
  - Grep App: Designed an app similar to the command-line grep feature. It allows for regular expression matching on lines from files that belong to a given directory. The app was tested on a txt file with over 900000 words.


## Highlighted Projects
**Discord Bot**: Programmed a bot on the Discord application that can perform tasks for a publicly hosted messaging and voice server. It is developed using Python and uses discord.py API.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Coded projects such as the Cluster Monitoring Agent that can be used by software teams to perform resource management over multiple nodes. Learned new languages and technologies prior to implementation of projects. Worked with team members to solve problems and hosted daily meetings for updates and assistance on projects.
