# David Huynh . Jarvis Consulting

My goal is to grow and develop new skills to be the best version of myself. My favourite thing to do is to learn new programming languages as well as solve coding problems where I can put my algorithm skills to the test. Within the software industry, I hope to provide all the support and knowledge that I have gained to create a better work environment for my team members and leaders. I also wish to meet new people and be able to make the workplace a place of leisure and enjoyment as well.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented Bash scripts that would allow the collection of hosts' hardware information and usage from nodes of a cluster. This data would be stored in a PostgresSQL database hosted by Docker. The scripts would be continuously scheduled to run using Cron or Crontab jobs.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Not Started
  - JDBC App: Created an app that allows one to manipulate customer data from a PostgreSQL database using a Data Access Object within Java. This allows a user to manipulate a database with transactions without calling multiple the queries.
  - Grep App: Designed an app similar to the command-line grep feature. It allows for regular expression matching on lines from files that belong to a given directory. The app was tested on a txt file with over 900000 words.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/springboot)]: Not Started

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: Not Started

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/hadoop)]: Not Started

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/spark)]: Not Started

**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidHuynh/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: Not Started


## Highlighted Projects
**Discord Bot**: Programmed a bot on the Discord that can perform tasks for a publicly hosted messaging and call server. It is developed using Python and uses discord.py API.
